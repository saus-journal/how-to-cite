# Scale

The scale should be included in the reference entry only when the cited work is a map. However, including the scale is optional for historical maps produced before the 19th century, as they often lack scales altogether. Even when a scale is present on maps created prior to the mid-19th century, it can typically only be estimated and expressed approximately using modern scale ratio units. For maps published from the second half of the 19th century onward, it is recommended that the scale be included in the reference entry.

## Hint:

Many historical maps are now available in digital format, provided by a range of public and private institutions. Scale information is often included in the digital map’s metadata, although not always. When available, this information may be included in the reference entry, with the clarification that the scale is approximate (see below for details).

The map scale is regarded as a secondary attribute of the work’s type and should be included within the same square brackets, separated by a comma, alongside the work’s type. The scale value is expressed as a ratio using modern metric units, for example, 1:50000 (meaning 1 centimeter on the map corresponds to 50000 centimeters, or 0.5 kilometers, in reality). If the scale is approximate or uncertain, the abbreviation **ca.** (circa) should be placed before the scale value.
