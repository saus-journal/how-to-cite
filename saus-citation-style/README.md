# SAUS Citation Style

The SAUS citation style is a variant of the **author–date system**. In this system, each source is cited in the text with an **in-line citation** that includes the _author’s name_, _year of publication_, and _locator(s)_ (such as page numbers, figure numbers, or section headings). This citation corresponds to a full entry in the **reference list**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
While it has become increasingly common to omit locators when citing sources, the SAUS style permits this only in specific cases: when the source lacks page numbers — such as certain electronic documents, standalone maps, or other non-paginated materials — or when referring to an entire work rather than a specific part. In all other cases, **appropriate locators**, such as page numbers, figure references, or section titles, **must be included**.
{% endhint %}

**Footnotes** should be used **sparingly** and primarily for brief clarifications or **closely related** supplemental information.

{% hint style="success" %}
In-text citations may also be included in footnotes, as long as the footnote contains additional commentary.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Avoid** using footnotes as a space for **excessive referencing** or **tangential commentary**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Footnotes that consist solely of citation information are **not allowed**.
{% endhint %}
