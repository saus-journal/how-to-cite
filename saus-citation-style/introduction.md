# Introduction

The SAUS citation style is a variant of the **author-date system**. In this system, each source is cited in the main text with an **in-text citation** that includes the author’s name, the publication year, and locators. Each in-line citation corresponds to a full entry in the **reference list**.

## Always include locators when possible

While it has become increasingly common to omit locators when citing sources, the SAUS style permits this only in specific cases: when the source lacks page numbers — such as certain electronic documents, standalone maps, or other non-paginated materials — or when referring to an entire work rather than a specific part. In all other cases, **appropriate locators**, such as page numbers, figure references, or section titles, **must be included**.

#### In-Text Citations in Footnotes

In-text citations may be included in footnotes as long as the footnote contains additional commentary. However, **footnotes consisting solely of citation information are not allowed**.
