# Key Elements of a Citation and Reference



## Author Name

## Title

### Definition

In a reference entry, the **title** refers to the name of the specific work being cited.

### Subtitle

Subtitles are an integral part of a work's title and should always be included in the reference. When a work has both a title and a subtitle:

* Use the original punctuation as it appears in the source.
* If no punctuation is used in the original (e.g., the subtitle appears on a new line), separate the title and subtitle with a **colon**.

### Titles of Multivolume Works

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Multivolume Works vs Series
{% endhint %}

In multivolume works, **the volume number ‚Äî always expressed using Arabic numerals ‚Äî is considered part of the title** and should be separated from the main title with a comma.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Example:

_The Economic History of Byzantium from the Seventh through the Fifteenth Century, Vol. 1_
{% endhint %}

If the individual volumes in a multivolume work have their own titles, the structure should be as follows:

* The title of the multivolume work (including the volume number) is treated as the main title.
* The individual volume title is treated as a **subtitle** and separated with a colon.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Examples:

_Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan, Vol. 4: The Early Islamic House_

_Excavations At Sara√ßhane In Istanbul, Vol. 2: The Pottery_
{% endhint %}

### Titles of Multilingual Publications

If **English** is one of the publication languages, the English title should be used in the reference.\
If **English is not** among the publication languages, the title should be cited in the **primary publication language**, which is typically:

* the native language of the author of the referenced work, or
* the official language of the country where the publishing house is based.

### Works without Titles

In rare cases where a cited work lacks a formal title (e.g., unpublished reports, archival materials, field notes), the author should supply a **brief descriptive title in sentence case**, placed in **square brackets**. This approach aids clarity while clearly indicating that the title is editorial and not part of the original source.

### Italicization

Titles should be **italicized** in the reference list only when the cited work is a **standalone publication** ‚Äî such as a book, map, report, or film.\
When referencing a work that is **part of a larger whole** ‚Äî such as a journal article or book chapter ‚Äî the title of **the part should not be italicized**, while the title of **the containing work** (e.g., the journal or edited volume) **must be italicized**.

### Capitalization

Titles should be cited exactly **as they appear in the original publication**. The SAUS style does not enforce a standard English capitalization rule, such as title case or sentence case, on original titles.

However, if the original **English** title is written in **all capital letters**, it should be cited using **title case**.

**Original:**

RESULTS OF EXCAVATIONS\

THE AMERICAN SCHOOL OF CLASSICAL STUDIES IN ATHENS\
VOLUME IX\
THE ISLAMIC COINS

**SAUS Reference Entry:**

_The Athenian Agora: Results of Excavations Conducted by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Vol. 9: The Islamic Coins_
{% endhint %}

### Translation and Transliteration

Titles in languages other than English should **not be translated**. They should be **transliterated** according to the journal‚Äôs transliteration policy.

## Bibliographic Identifiers

Bibliographic identifiers are unique codes assigned to publications and other research outputs to distinguish them and link them to related resources. They play a crucial role in accurately tracking, retrieving, and citing sources, ensuring proper attribution and facilitating long-term access to scholarly materials.

{% hint style="info" %}
## **Identifiers and older publications**

Bibliographic identifiers are a relatively recent development. ISBNs and ISSNs were not commonly assigned before the 1970s, and DOIs and URLs are products of the digital age. However, due to the ongoing digitization of older scholarly works, it's increasingly common to find DOIs or stable URLs even for publications originally released without them ‚Äî sometimes decades or even centuries ago.

üí° **Tip:**

Try searching for older publications on platforms like [Google Books](https://books.google.com/) or [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). These services often provide stable URLs or even DOI metadata for digitized versions of historically important works ‚Äî even if the original physical edition had none.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
## **Best Practice**:

Always include an identifier in the reference entry if one exists ‚Äî even if you consulted a physical copy of the work that predates the use of such identifiers (e.g., a print edition of a 19th-century book or an early 20th-century journal article).
{% endhint %}



When adding entries to the reference list, include available identifiers in the following order of preference:

1. **DOI (Digital Object Identifier)**\
   Always include the DOI if one is available.
2. **URL**\
   If no DOI exists, provide a stable, reliable URL (e.g., from an institutional repository, publisher‚Äôs site, or trusted digital library).
3. **ISBN / ISSN**\
   If neither a DOI nor a stable URL is available, include the ISBN (for books) or ISSN (for journal articles and other serials).
4. **Other identifiers**   \
   If none of the above is available, consider including other stable bibliographic identifiers where applicable. Examples include:
   * _**OCLC number**_ (from WorldCat or library catalogs)
   * _**Library of Congress Control Number (LCCN)**_
   * _**ARK**_ (Archival Resource Key)
   * _**Handle**_ (from institutional repositories)
   * _**National bibliographic identifiers**_ (e.g., BNB, DNB, etc.)



Make sure identifiers are formatted as **active hyperlinks** whenever possible, to support direct access.
