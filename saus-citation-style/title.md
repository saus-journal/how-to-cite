# Title



## Subtitle

Subtitles are an integral part of a work's title and should always be included in the reference. When a work has both a main title and a subtitle:

* Use the original punctuation as it appears in the source.
* If no punctuation is used in the original (e.g., the subtitle appears on a new line), separate the title and subtitle with a **colon**.

## Titles of Multivolume Works

In multivolume works, **the volume number** — always expressed using **Arabic numerals** — is considered **part of the title** and should be separated from the main title with a **comma**.

## Example:

The Economic History of Byzantium from the Seventh through the Fifteenth Century, Vol. 1
{% endhint %}

If the individual volumes in a multivolume work have their own titles, the structure should be as follows:

* The title of the multivolume work (including the volume number) is treated as the main title.
* The individual volume title is treated as a subtitle and separated with a colon.

Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan, Vol. 4: The Early Islamic House

Excavations At Saraçhane In Istanbul, Vol. 2: The Pottery

## Titles of Multilingual Publications

If **English** is one of the publication languages, the English title should be used in the reference.\
If **English is not** among the publication languages, the title should be cited in the **primary publication language**, which is typically:

* the native language of the author of the referenced work, or
* the official language of the country where the publishing house is based.

## Works Without Titles

In rare cases where a cited work lacks a formal title (e.g., unpublished reports, archival materials, field notes), the author should supply a **brief descriptive title in sentence case**, placed in **square brackets**. This approach aids clarity while clearly indicating that the title is editorial and not part of the original source.
