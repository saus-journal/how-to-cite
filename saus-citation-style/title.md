# Title

## Main Title

The main title of a work is its primary identifying name, taken directly from the source. When no title is present, it is recommended to supply a brief descriptive title in square brackets.

## Subtitle

Subtitles are an integral part of a work's title and should always be included in the reference. When a work has both a main title and a subtitle:

* Use the original punctuation as it appears in the source.
* If no punctuation is used in the original (e.g., the subtitle appears on a new line), separate the title and subtitle with a **colon**.

## Titles of Multivolume Works

In multivolume works, **the volume number** — always expressed using **Arabic numerals** — is considered **part of the title** and should be separated from the main title with a **comma**.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Example:

The Economic History of Byzantium from the Seventh through the Fifteenth Century, Vol. 1.
{% endhint %}

If the individual volumes in a multivolume work have their own titles, the structure should be as follows:

* The title of the multivolume work (including the volume number) is treated as the main title.
* The individual volume title is treated as a subtitle and separated with a colon.

## Examples:

Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan, Vol. 4: The Early Islamic House.

Excavations At Saraçhane In Istanbul, Vol. 2: The Pottery.
{% endhint %}

## Titles of Multilingual Publications

If **English** is one of the publication languages, the English title should be used in the reference.\
If **English is not** among the publication languages, the title should be cited in the **primary publication language**, which is typically:

* the native language of the author of the referenced work, or
* the official language of the country where the publishing house is based.

## Works Without Titles

In rare cases where a cited work lacks a formal title (e.g., unpublished reports, archival materials, field notes), the author should supply a **brief descriptive title in sentence case**, placed in **square brackets**. This approach aids clarity while clearly indicating that the title is editorial and not part of the original source.

## Example&#x20;

\[Çatalhöyük excavations, scientific report on the results of the 2023 campaign]
{% endhint %}

## Italicization

Titles should be **italicized** in the reference list only when the cited work is a **standalone publication** — such as a book, map, report, or film.\
When referencing a work that is **part of a larger whole** — such as a journal article or book chapter — the title of **the part should not be italicized**, while the title of **the containing work** (e.g., the journal or edited volume) **must be italicized**.

{% endhint %}

## Capitalization

Titles should be cited exactly **as they appear in the original publication**. The SAUS style does not enforce a standard English capitalization rule, such as title case or sentence case, on original titles.

However, if the original **English** title is written in **all capital letters**, it should be cited using **title case**.

## Translation and Transliteration
