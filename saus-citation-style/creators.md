# Creators

Where known, the **names of a work’s primary creators** should be included in both **in-text citations** and the **reference list**.

The names of the work's **secondary creators** appear **only in the reference list**.

## Note:

While **authors** are generally recognized as the **primary creators** of a work, there are notable exceptions worth considering.

In some cases — particularly with modern editions or translations of ancient texts — **editors** and **translators** may serve as **de facto primary creators** of the cited work. The name of the original author may appear only in the title, while the edition itself is shaped largely by the scholarly contributions of the editor or translator, such as critical apparatus, contextual commentary, or interpretive framing. As a result, they should be cited as the main creators in both in-text citations and reference lists.

**Contributors** become **primary creators** only when the specific section of the work they authored is the focus of the citation. For example, in a monograph with one or more authors, additional contributors may be responsible for discrete sections (e.g., appendices, technical notes, catalogues), but are not considered (co-)authors of the entire work. When citing the monograph as a whole, these contributors are typically not named. However, when referencing their specific contributions, they are cited as the primary creator of the cited part.

In certain fields, such as **cartography**, other contributors — such as **illustrators** or **engravers** — may play a central creative role. In such cases, they may be regarded as **factual co-authors**, and their names should be included immediately after the cartographer’s name in the reference list, even when citing the primary work as a whole.

## Reference List

## In-Text Citations

The names of a work’s authors should appear in the reference entry in the following format: “**Surname, Initials**.”

In in-text citations, only the surname is used — unless the reference list includes works by two or more authors with the same surname published in the same year, in which case the initials are included as well.

If the bibliography contains works by different authors sharing the same surname and first name, published in the same year, the middle initial should also be added after the first initial. This applies to both reference entries and in-text citations.
