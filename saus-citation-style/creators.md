# Creators

Where known, the **names of a work’s primary creators** should be included in both **in-text citations** and the **reference list**.

The **names of a work’s secondary creators** — such as editors, translators, commentators, or illustrators — appear **only in the reference list, not in in-text citations**. The same applies to the creators of the parent work in which a cited item appears (e.g., an edited volume, collective monograph, or encyclopedia).

## Note:

While **authors** are generally recognized as the **primary creators** of a work, there are notable exceptions worth considering.

In some cases — particularly with modern editions or translations of ancient texts — **editors** and **translators** may serve as **de facto primary creators** of the cited work. The name of the original author may appear only in the title, while the edition itself is shaped largely by the scholarly contributions of the editor or translator, such as critical apparatus, contextual commentary, or interpretive framing. As a result, they should be cited as the main creators in both in-text citations and reference lists.

**Contributors** become **primary creators** only when the specific section of the work they authored is the focus of the citation. For example, in a monograph with one or more authors, additional contributors may be responsible for discrete sections (e.g., appendices, technical notes, catalogues), but are not considered (co-)authors of the entire work. When citing the monograph as a whole, these contributors are typically not named. However, when referencing their specific contributions, they are cited as the primary creator of the cited part.

In certain fields, such as **cartography**, other contributors — such as **illustrators** or **engravers** — may play a central creative role. In such cases, they may be regarded as **factual co-authors**, and their names should be included immediately after the cartographer’s name in the reference list, even when citing the primary work as a whole.

## Reference List

The names of a work’s primary and secondary creators should appear in the reference entry in the following format: “**Surname, Initials**.”

If the reference list contains works by different primary creators sharing the same surname and first name, published in the same year, **the middle initial** should also be added after the first initial.

If a work has **two or more creators**, all names should be listed — up to a maximum of 20 — and separated by commas, **without the use of et al.**

If **more than 20 creators** are listed, the first 19 and the final name should be included, with an ellipsis (...) inserted between the 19th and the last name to indicate the omission of intervening names.

## In-Text Citations

In in-text citations, usually **only the surname** is used.

However, when the reference list includes works by two or more primary creators with the same surname published in the same year, **the initials** are included as well.

If the reference list contains works by different primary creators sharing the same surname and first name, published in the same year, **the middle initial** should be added after the first initial in the in-text citation as well.

If a work has **two creators**, both names are listed, separated by a comma.

For works with **three or more creators**, only the first author's name is shown, followed by the abbreviation "et al."
