# Creators

Where known, the **names of a work’s creators** should be included in both **in-text citations** and the **reference list**.



The names of a work’s authors should appear in the reference entry in the following format: “**Surname, Initials**.”

In in-text citations, only the surname is used — unless the reference list includes works by two or more authors with the same surname published in the same year, in which case the initials are included as well.

If the bibliography contains works by different authors sharing the same surname and first name, published in the same year, the middle initial should also be added after the first initial. This applies to both reference entries and in-text citations.
