# Date

The publication date of a work is included in both in-text citations and the reference list. In in-text citations, **only the year** is shown. This is also the case in most reference list entries. However, in certain instances—such as when citing a newspaper article—the **full date in day-month-year format** is used in the reference list.

If **multiple works by the same author from the same year** appear in the reference list, they are distinguished in in-text citations by adding **lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet (a, b, c, etc.)** after the year.

Several options are available for indicating the publication date, depending on the information known:

* If the exact publication year is known, output the **year** (e.g., 2020).
* If the exact publication years of both the original edition and a reprint are known, output **year \[original year]** (e.g., 1990 \[1875]).
* If the publication year can only be estimated, output **ca. year** (e.g., ca. 1750).
* If the publication falls within a known time range, output **year–year** (e.g., 1750–1790).
* If the time range can only be estimated, output **ca. year–year** (e.g., ca. 1750–1790).
* If the publication year is unknown, output **n.d.** (i.e., "no date").
* If the work has been accepted but not yet published, output **forthcoming**.
