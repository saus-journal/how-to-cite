## Examples

### Book with a single author

### Book with two or more authors

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only cite a book with two or more authors as a whole (with all authors listed) if the work was fully co-authored, with no distinction between who wrote which sections.

If different sections or chapters were written by different contributors, you should cite the individual chapter or section â€” **not** the book as a whole. In such cases, treat the book as a collective, non-edited monograph, and include each relevant contribution separately in the reference list.
