# Types of Scholarly Works

on provides a clear classification and explanation of common types of scholarly works cited in archaeological research. Understanding these categories — from broad collections like series and multivolume works to specific items such as journal articles, book chapters, datasets, and digital resources — helps authors accurately identify and reference sources according to best bibliographic practices.

### Texts

<details>

<summary><strong>Series</strong></summary>

A series is an open-ended collection of independent scholarly works, often by different authors or teams, grouped by a broadly defined theme or institutional framework. Series include monographs that vary in focus and are not components of a single overarching work.

<summary><strong>Multivolume Works</strong></summary>

A multivolume work is a cohesive scholarly project published across several volumes under a shared main title (e.g., Peristeria or The Athenian Agora).

While such works are typically intended to be finite, the total number of volumes may not be defined at the outset, especially in long-term archaeological projects.

Each volume may have its own subtitle or focus, but the set is designed to function as a single, structured publication — often presenting the results of long-lasting and/or large-scale excavations.

A multivolume work may sometimes be published as part of a larger series.

#### Multivolume Works vs Series

While the distinction between series and multi-volume works is generally clear in theory, it can be challenging to apply in practice. This is especially true when series volumes appear uniform or when multi-volume works, with each volume individually titled, are published over the course of decades. When there is uncertainty, it is advisable to refer to reliable bibliographic sources or to follow the formal presentation of the relationship between volumes by the publisher.

<summary><strong>Books / Monographs</strong></summary>

> In these guidelines, the term **monograph** is used — following the definition in the [CSE Manual](https://www.csemanual.org/Home.html) — not in the traditional sense of a scholarly treatise on a specific subject, but rather to refer to a work that is complete in a single volume or a limited number of volumes, i.e., more or less synonymous with a **book**. The term encompasses a broad range of _standalone publications_. A special case is represented by _theses_ and _dissertations_, which are understood as unpublished monographic works.

#### Monograph

A scholarly book written by one or more authors that presents a coherent, unified study, without distinguishing or quantifying the individual contributions of each author.

#### Collective (Collaborative) Monograph

A standalone book in which individual chapters (or groups of chapters) are authored by different contributors, but the work is published as a unified volume without a designated editor.

#### Edited Volume

A book in which individual chapters or sections are contributed by various authors and compiled by one or more editors who organize and oversee the content.

#### Thesis / Dissertation

An academic work submitted in fulfillment of degree requirements, often archived or made publicly accessible online, but distinct from commercial books. Due to their specific nature, theses and dissertations typically lack conventional publication details such as a publisher and place of publication; instead, they are associated with a university and an archival repository.

<summary><strong>Book Sections</strong></summary>

An academic book section is a distinct, titled part of a book. Examples include:

* Chapters
* Encyclopedia or dictionary articles
* Papers within edited volumes (including conference proceedings published as books)

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Periodical Articles</strong></summary>

A periodical article is a written work published within a periodical — a publication issued at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually.

#### Journal Article

A scholarly article published in an academic journal, whether peer-reviewed or not.

#### Magazine Article

An article published in a general-interest or professional magazine aimed at a broad or specialized audience outside of strictly academic journals.

#### Newspaper Article

An article published in a daily or weekly newspaper.

<summary><strong>Manuscripts / Typescripts</strong></summary>

Unpublished texts, either handwritten or produced using a typewriter or word processor.

From a bibliographic or cataloguing perspective, they do not form a homogeneous group, as their structure can vary: some are standalone works (similar to books or monographs), while others are parts of bound volumes (comparable to book sections).

Nevertheless, manuscripts — especially older handwritten ones — often have distinctive features, such as frequently lacking formal titles, and follow a specific tradition in the description and designation of their internal elements. For these reasons, they are generally treated as a special category of texts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Although theses and dissertations are technically unpublished manuscripts, their formal presentation, comprehensive content, and academic function often position them closer to published monographs than to typical unpublished texts.
