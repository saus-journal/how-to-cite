# Components of Reference Entry

Think of a reference entry as a _sentence_. The main components—the **building blocks**—such as author names, titles, dates, publisher names, and identifiers, function as the _nouns_ that convey essential information. When information for certain building blocks—such as the author's name, publication date, publisher, or place of publication—is unavailable, it is typically replaced with standardized **substitutes**.

Connecting and descriptive terms and abbreviations, such as (ed.) for “edited by,” (transl.) for “translated by,” “In:” for “appears in,” and qualifiers like “ca.” for “approximately,” serve as _verbs_, _prepositions_, or _modifiers_. They clarify the relationships and roles that link these building blocks together. Together, these **linking elements** show how each part interacts within the citation, forming a coherent and structured statement that precisely indicates who did what, where, when, and under what circumstances.

### Building Blocks

<details>

<summary><strong>Creators</strong></summary>

Creators are individuals or entities responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of a work. In bibliographic terms, they include all roles involved in producing, shaping, or presenting a work’s content, and are typically grouped as primary, secondary, or contributing creators based on their function.

#### Primary Creators

These are the individuals or organizations chiefly responsible for the original intellectual or creative content of the entire work. Examples include:

* **Authors** (of books, articles, theses, datasets, etc.)
* **Cartographers** (when the map itself is the main product of authorship)

#### Secondary Creators

These contribute significantly to the form or transmission of the work, but are not responsible for its original intellectual content. Examples include:

* **Editors** (of edited volumes, critical editions)
* **Translators**
* **Compilers** (e.g., in bibliographies, collections)

#### Contributors

These are individuals associated with a part of the work, or who add value to it in a supporting role. They are usually credited when citing a specific component. Examples include:

* **Authors of specific book sections** (in both monographs and edited volumes)
* **Illustrators** and **engravers** (e.g., for maps)
