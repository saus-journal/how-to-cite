# Components of Reference Entry

Think of a reference entry as a _sentence_. The main components—the **building blocks**—such as author names, titles, dates, publisher names, and identifiers, function as the _nouns_ that convey essential information. When information for certain building blocks—such as the author's name, publication date, publisher, or place of publication—is unavailable, it is typically replaced with standardized **substitutes**.

Connecting and descriptive terms and abbreviations, such as (ed.) for “edited by,” (transl.) for “translated by,” “In:” for “appears in,” and qualifiers like “ca.” for “approximately,” serve as _verbs_, _prepositions_, or _modifiers_. They clarify the relationships and roles that link these building blocks together. Together, these **linking elements** show how each part interacts within the citation, forming a coherent and structured statement that precisely indicates who did what, where, when, and under what circumstances.

### Building Blocks

<details>

<summary><strong>Creators</strong></summary>

Creators are individuals or entities responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of a work. In bibliographic terms, they include all roles involved in producing, shaping, or presenting a work’s content, and are typically grouped as primary, secondary, or contributing creators based on their function.

#### Primary Creators

These are the individuals or organizations chiefly responsible for the original intellectual or creative content of the entire work. Examples include:

* **Authors** (of books, articles, theses, datasets, etc.)
* **Cartographers** (when the map itself is the main product of authorship)

#### Secondary Creators

These contribute significantly to the form or transmission of the work, but are not responsible for its original intellectual content. Examples include:

* **Editors** (of edited volumes, critical editions)
* **Translators**
* **Compilers** (e.g., in bibliographies, collections)

#### Contributors

These are individuals associated with a part of the work, or who add value to it in a supporting role. They are usually credited when citing a specific component. Examples include:

* **Authors of specific book sections** (in both monographs and edited volumes)
* **Illustrators** and **engravers** (e.g., for maps)

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Date</strong></summary>

The year (or exact date) the work was published or made available.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Title</strong></summary>

The name of the work. This includes:

* **Main title**
* **Subtitle**
* **Volume number and name** (for multivolume works)

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Type</strong></summary>

This component indicates the type of work being cited, such as a map, thesis, or dataset. It helps clarify the nature of the resource and distinguishes it from more conventional publications like books or journal articles.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Scale</strong></summary>

The scale component is included in reference entries when relevant to the type of work — typically maps and other spatial representations — where scale is a defining attribute.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Container Title</strong></summary>

The title of the larger work that contains the cited item, such as the journal title or the book title of an edited volume.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Collection Title</strong></summary>

The title of a series or a multi-part collection to which the work belongs.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Publisher Data</strong></summary>

Information about who published the work and where:

* **Place of publication**
* **Publisher name**

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Archive Data</strong></summary>

For unpublished or archival works:

* **Archive place** (location of the archive)
* **Archive name** (e.g., university library, national archive)

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Locators</strong></summary>

Specific parts of a work that pinpoint the cited section. Examples include:

* **Page numbers**
* **Figures**
* **Tables**
* **Folios**
* **Footnotes**

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Identifiers</strong></summary>

Unique or standardized codes that identify the work. Examples include:

* DOI (Digital Object Identifier)
* URL (web address)
* ISBN (International Standard Book Number)
* ISSN (International Standard Serial Number)

</details>

### Substitutes

<details>

<summary><strong>Missing Author</strong></summary>

When the author of a work is unknown, the name is substituted in different ways depending on the citation style. The most common approaches include:

* replacing the author’s name with the title of the work
* using the term Anonymous (or its abbreviated form Anon.)

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Missing Date</strong></summary>

When the creation or publication date of a work is unknown and cannot be reliably estimated, it is replaced with a “no date” indicator, the exact form of which may vary depending on the citation style used.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Missing Publisher Information</strong></summary>

When the **publisher** of a work is unknown, it is replaced with a “no publisher” indicator, the exact form of which may vary depending on the citation style used.\
Similarly, if the **place of publication** is unknown, it is replaced with a “no place” indicator.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Missing Locators Information</strong></summary>

When locators — such as page numbers, paragraph numbers, or other reference markers — are absent from a source where they would typically be provided, a “no locator” indicator is used. This often occurs in electronic publications that omit pagination found in the original print edition, or in online works lacking paragraph numbering. The exact form of this indicator varies according to the citation style applied.

</details>

### Linking Elements

<details>

<summary><strong>Creators Terms</strong></summary>

If a name is not accompanied by a descriptive term, it is assumed to belong to the primary creator of the work, typically the author.\
The names of secondary creators and contributors are accompanied by standardized, localized descriptive terms. Depending on the citation style, these may appear as full nouns (e.g., editor, translator, contributor), abbreviations (e.g., ed., transl., contrib.), or prepositional phrases (e.g., edited by, translated by).

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Date Status Terms</strong></summary>

When the publication date is uncertain but can be reasonably estimated, it is typically accompanied by a localized term indicating approximation. In English and other Western European languages, the Latin word circa is commonly used, usually in its abbreviated form (ca.).

If the work has not yet been published but is expected to be released soon, it is accompanied by a localized term indicating its pending status, such as _in press_ or _forthcoming_.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Scale Term</strong></summary>

The value of the “Scale” building block — for example, 1:50,000 — should be accompanied by a localized term such as “Scale”.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>In Term</strong></summary>

The localized “In” term (e.g., In:) is typically placed before the title of the larger work that contains the referenced item—such as a journal, an edited volume, or a collective monograph. In the case of edited volumes and collective monographs, the names of the creators of the larger work appear between the “In” term and the title.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Locators Terms</strong></summary>

The values of the "Locators" building block are accompanied by localized, typically abbreviated terms indicating the type of locator associated with each value (e.g., p. for "page," fig. for "figure," etc.). If no locator term is provided, the value is usually assumed to refer to page numbers.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Identifiers Terms</strong></summary>

Digital Object Identifier (DOI) values are typically not preceded by specific terms, as they are designed to be permanent and self-explanatory. Moreover, the standard DOI format includes the "[https://doi.org/](https://www.doi.org/)" prefix.\
Values of International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) and International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN) must be accompanied by their respective standard, non-localized abbreviations: ISBN and ISSN.\
URLs are introduced by standardized, localized prepositional phrases such as _Available at:_. Additionally, the access date should be indicated using terms like _Accessed_ or _Retrieved_.
