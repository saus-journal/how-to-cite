# Components of Reference Entry

Think of a reference entry as a _sentence_. The main components—the **building blocks**—such as author names, titles, dates, publisher names, and identifiers, function as the _nouns_ that convey essential information. Connecting terms and abbreviations, such as (ed.) for “edited by,” (transl.) for “translated by,” “In:” for “appears in,” and qualifiers like “ca.” for “approximately,” serve as _verbs_, _prepositions_, or _modifiers_. They clarify the relationships and roles that link these building blocks together. Together, these **linking elements** show how each part interacts within the citation, forming a coherent and structured statement that precisely indicates who did what, where, when, and under what circumstances.
