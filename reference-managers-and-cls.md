# Why Use Reference Management Software and CSL?

Human creativity—whether expressed in writing, art, or other forms—can take many shapes: manuscripts, journal articles, books, maps, films, and more. Each of these works carries a set of characteristics, or _metadata_, such as the author(s), title, publisher, date and place of publication, where it is stored, and unique identifiers (like DOIs or ISBNs).

Bibliographic management software — such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), or [EndNote](https://endnote.com/) — helps you organize and store this metadata by breaking each reference into smaller parts. These parts can then be automatically reassembled into properly formatted citations and reference lists.

The reassembly is handled by a technology called [CSL (Citation Style Language)](https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/index.html). CSL is a powerful and flexible language that defines how to format references according to different style rules (e.g., APA, Chicago, MLA). There are currently more than **11000 CSL styles** in use across journals and publishers worldwide.

However, none of the existing styles matched the exact formatting standards of our journal. That's why we created a **custom CSL style** tailored specifically for SAUS, to help our authors generate citations and reference lists effortlessly and accurately.

## **The good news**?

You don’t need to know how CSL works behind the scenes.

All you need to do is:

* Use a reference manager (we recommend [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)),
* Insert citations into your document with a few clicks, and
* Generate a correctly formatted bibliography at the end—with no manual editing.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to use Zotero effectively. Once you learn the basics, you’ll find that working with other reference managers is quite similar.
